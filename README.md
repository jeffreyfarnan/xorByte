#xorByte

Language: C

Description: A tool I created to help with Malware Analylsis which allows me to decrypt a buffer when encrypted with xor excryption. If I find the xor byte during analysis, plus copying the encrypted text and importing them into this tool allows me to check if this xor byte is correct.
